# NOSApp

A script that takes links of articles from the NOS (Dutch news site) Twitter account, validates it's an https://nos.nl link and scrapes the webpage for the important information in the article (headers and paragraphs). Maybe I'll add support for pictures/videos in the future. 

After that it sends it to the (custom) NOS app running on my Smartwatch (Samsung Gear S3).\
\
Motivation: The official NOS Smartwatch app sucks major ass.\
\
Progress:\
Webscraper: Done.\
App: In development (Tizen Wep Application)
