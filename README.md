# NOSApp

A script that takes links of articles from the NOS Twitter account, validates it's an https://nos.nl link and scrapes the webpage for the important information in the article (headers and paragraphs). Maybe I'll add support for pictures/videos in the future. 

After that it sends it to the NOS app running on my Smartwatch (Samsung Gear S3).\
Motivation: The official NOS Smartwatch app sucks major ass.\

Progress:\
Script: Done.\
App: Haven't started, cause I don't know how Android Studio works.
